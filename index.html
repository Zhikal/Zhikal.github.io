        <p>

            Hello, I'm Zhikal, currently enrolled in the GIS program at Nova Scotia Community College. 
            My professional journey began with obtaining a bachelor degree in Civil Engineering in 2015, and since then,
            I've gained valuable experience working with various companies.
            My transition to GIS was driven by the limitless possibilities this field offers. Recognizing the importance of the "science of where" in decision-making,
            I found my passion for leveraging geospatial technologies to make a positive impact.
            I am enthusiastic about contributing to the field of Geomatics. My journey involves continuous learning, 
            growth, and a commitment to making meaningful contributions.
